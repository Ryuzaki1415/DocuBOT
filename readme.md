### Understanding Your Crew

The DocuBot Crew is composed of multiple AI agents, each with unique roles, goals, and tools. These agents collaborate on a series of tasks, defined in `config/tasks.yaml`, leveraging their collective skills to achieve complex objectives. The `config/agents.yaml` file outlines the capabilities and configurations of each agent in the crew.


### Structure

-`src/docubot/crew.py` Contains the main logic and agent and task configuration.<br>
-`src/docubot/main.py` handles custom inputs and Driver code for the entire crew.
